This repository contains open-source packages that make it easier to integrate your design system with [UXPin Merge](https://uxpin.com/merge). Merge is a revolutionary technology that lets users import and keep in sync coded React.js components to the UXPin Editor. Imported components are 100% identical to the components used by developers during the development process. It means that components are going to look, feel and function (interactions, data) just like the real product experienced by the end-users. 

Currently this repo contains one package:

* [uxpin-merge-cli](packages/uxpin-merge-cli/Readme.md) â€“ a command-line tool to preview your design system locally and push it to UXPin Merge.
