## Motivation

Creating design system is not a one time project but an ongoing process that is never complete. Constant changes of existing components and optimization may cause a lack of synchronization between Design Systems and the existing code.

UXPin solution will allow designers and developers to work on the same UI patterns up-to-date with the Design System and code.

## multi-package repository

This repository consists of multiple tools allowing better integration of your Design System repository with [code.uxpin.com](http://code.uxpin.com) services. Look at the Readme file for each of them for more detailed description:
