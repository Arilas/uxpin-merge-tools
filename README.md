# UXPin code

## Motivation

Creating design system is not a one time project but an ongoing process that is never complete. Constant changes of existing components and optimization may cause a lack of synchronization between Design Systems and the existing code. 

UXPin solution will allow designers and developers to work on the same UI patterns up-to-date with the Design System and code.
